The repository contains the following materials organized by category:
A. Tool Configuration Files and Automation Scripts
â€¢	nmap_test.py, sql_test.py, metasploit_test.py: Python scripts for automating Nmap, SQLmap, and Metasploit respectively.
â€¢	validate_script.py: The central validation orchestration script integrating alert parsing, sandbox execution, and result logging.
â€¢	docker-compose.yml: Docker Compose configuration used to set up the sandbox environment with predefined vulnerable services.
B. Alert Samples

C. Evaluation Logs and Output Files
â€¢	output_nmap.txt: Captured Nmap results including open ports and service detection logs.
â€¢	output_sql.txt: SQLmap output logs indicating injection testing outcomes.
â€¢	output_metasploit.txt: Session logs and exploit outcomes from automated Metasploit runs.
